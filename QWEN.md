## Qwen Added Memories
- AI Job Applier Project Context: Today we successfully reorganized the existing project into a professional monorepo structure with microservices architecture. The project now has: apps/ directory with user-service, auth-service, job-discovery-service, and api-gateway; packages/ directory with shared libraries (shared, database, auth, utils, types); complete documentation in docs/; CI/CD workflows in .github/workflows; Docker configuration; and all changes committed to the git repository. The project is in excellent shape with clean architecture, TypeScript throughout, and proper development practices. The repository is at commit be72635 with 2 commits ahead of origin/main. To push changes: git push origin main.
