# Git Setup and Push Commands for AI Job Applier

# Navigate to the project directory
cd C:\Users\shara\OneDrive\Documents\ai-job-applier\new-structure

# Add your remote repository (replace with your actual repository URL)
# Example for GitHub:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git

# Push the main branch to the remote repository
git push -u origin main

# Alternative: If you're pushing to an existing repository with content,
# you might need to force push or merge first:
# git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
# Then resolve any conflicts and push again:
# git push -u origin main
